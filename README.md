My Portfolio Starter (HTML + CSS + JS)

Hi! This is just a simple portfolio template I made. Super easy to change and make it yours.

Project Structure

index.html — all the sections: Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact

style.css — responsive styles, light & dark mode

script.js — mobile menu, theme toggle, project cards, contact fallback

assets/img/ — put your images here (I added a few placeholders already)

How I Use It

Open index.html in a browser to see it.

Change your name, bio, and links in index.html.

Update projects in script.js: img, title, desc, tags, live, code

Replace placeholder images in assets/img/ with your own, make sure filenames match

Change you@example.com to your real email

Deploy

GitHub Pages: push folder → Settings → Pages → Deploy from root

Netlify / Vercel: just drag & drop

Optional: EmailJS

Make an account

Get Service ID, Template ID, Public Key

Replace mailto fallback in script.js with emailjs. send(...)

Done! You can now tweak it and make it yours. ✨
