My Portfolio Starter (Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS)

Hey! This is a simple, beginner-friendly portfolio template I built. You can easily customize it and make it your own.

📂 Project Structure

index.html — all the main page sections: Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact.

style.css — clean, responsive styles (supports light & dark modes).

script.js — handles mobile menu, theme toggle, project cards, and contact fallback.

assets/img/ — put your images here (I’ve added a few placeholders to get started).

🚀 How to Use

Open index.html in your browser to see it live.

Update your name, bio, and links directly in index.html.

Change the projects list in script.js:

Update img, title, desc, tags, live, and code for your projects.

Replace placeholder images in assets/img/ with your own and make sure filenames match script.js.

Change you@example.com to your real email in index.html and script.js.

🌐 Deploy Anywhere

GitHub Pages: Push this folder → Settings → Pages → Deploy from root.

Netlify / Vercel: Just drag & drop the folder into the dashboard.

✉️ Optional: EmailJS Setup

Make an account at EmailJS.

Get your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key.

Replace the fallback mailto in script.js with emailjs.send(...).

That’s it! Have fun building and customizing your portfolio. ✨
